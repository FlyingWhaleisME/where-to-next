## 🔧 **Quick Fixes (Try in Order)**

### **Fix 1: Refresh the Page** ⚡
**Easiest and fastest solution**
- Press `Ctrl+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+R` (Mac)
- Or click the refresh button in your browser
- **Why:** Re-establishes connection with your current login

### **Fix 2: Logout and Login Again** 🔑
**Most reliable solution**
1. Click **"Logout"** in the top-right corner
2. Click **"Login"** and enter your credentials
3. **Why:** Generates a fresh authentication token

### **Fix 3: Check Your Internet** 🌐
**Make sure you're connected**
- Try visiting another website
- Check your WiFi/network connection
- **Why:** WebSocket needs internet connection

### **Fix 4: Wait and Retry** ⏰

## 🎯 **What Should Happen After Fixing**

### **Success Indicators:**

3. **Check if other users can see it**
4. **Check Users tab for online users**

## 🚨 **If Still Offline After All Fixes**

### **Check Backend Server:**
The website backend might be down. Ask the person who set up the website to:
1. **Check if backend is running** in their terminal
2. **Restart the backend server** if needed
3. **Check for error messages** in the terminal

### **Common Error Messages:**
- **"Connection refused"** → Backend server is down

## 💡 **Prevention Tips**

### **Stay Online:**

- **Login regularly** to keep token fresh
- **Use the same browser** for consistency

### **If You Get Disconnected:**
- **Don't panic** - it's usually easy to fix
- **Try refresh first** - often works immediately
- **Login again if needed** - takes 30 seconds
